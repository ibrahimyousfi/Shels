# 🔬 Technical Comparison

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Shels | Traditional Tools | AI-Powered Tools |
|--------|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Context Window** | 1M tokens (single pass) | N/A (file-by-file) | 128K-200K (chunked) |
| **Codebase Analysis** | Entire project at once | File-by-file | Chunked analysis |
| **State Management** | Thought Signatures | Stateless | Session-based |
| **Autonomous Operation** | 24/7 with self-correction | Manual triggers | Scheduled jobs |
| **Reasoning Depth** | Multi-step chains | Rule-based | Single-step |
| **Business Integration** | Native (ROI, revenue) | None | None |
| **Learning Capability** | Self-correction (40% improvement) | Static rules | Limited |
